# Deepfake detection using Deep Learning (ResNext and LSTM)

## 1. Introduction
This projects aims in detection of video deepfakes using deep learning techniques like ResNext and LSTM. We have achived deepfake detection by using transfer learning where the pretrained ResNext CNN is used to obtain a feature vector, further the LSTM layer is trained using the features.

# Executions strategy:
Execute all the jupyter notebook files uploaded after making sure the dataset is uploaded properly on your device / drive and do specify the path in proper manner. 
Follow the documentation uploaded for more details. 
The project report and presentation is also attached here.
